Avocet Tools
##############

Avocet Editorial Consulting provides technical writers and developers for documentation needs.  

Avocet Tools is a project aimed at developing a standard set of command-line tools to assist technical and fiction writers in common tasks and operations.  

This project is currently migrating from Python to Elixir, in order to build a more robust, functional platform supporting multiple build approaches.  The legacy Python and Cython code can be found in the ``python/`` directory.
